### About this project

Recently I came across with Francesco Ciulla on Twitter, who is introvertuber, if you don't know what does that mean, its a youtuber who is introvert. Since then he helped me to push myself out of that introvert zone. So, token of appreciation, I have created this site as a christmas gift for him on the behalf of all developer community.

If you are looking to thank to him for his great work in person, you can do that as well. So, to do that, please go to the file [`assets/messages.json`](https://github.com/DentedCode/introvertuber-francesco-gift/blob/main/assets/messages.json) and leave your twitter handle, thumbnail link and message for him, it will be published on the `/loved` page of the website.

### Do the same

If you feel like doing the same to someone that you admire, feel free to use this project to modify and gift to the one you love.
